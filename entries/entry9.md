### Hook

Usually hooks hook people's interests, and most of the times hooks are questions, so is mine. It was quite easy for me to come up with a hook, as my hook is just a simple fact that presents the utility of `gosu` in a situation like the Hackathon, where you have to code a MVP in less than 48 hours, one can easily code a simple 2 dimensional game in less than 48 hours if he/she has enough knowledge about `gosu`.

### Introduction

Transition to the introduction of `gosu` is simple. Many people mistakenly think `gosu` is a language. In fact, it is not a language. It is a development library for other languages such as `C++` and `Ruby`. In my case, I use `gosu` for the `Ruby` language. Therefore, I had to follow the procedure of installation for `Ruby`, which is a lot different than the requirements for `C++`. 

### Challenges

I listed the major challenges that I faced while coding the game, excluding the most challenging issue that I faced before even getting into the actual code. Disregard the challenges prior to actually coding the parkour game, I had to look into ways to create a map, assign a sprite sheet for both the characters and tiles, and more. 

## Takeaways
- **Keep things simple.** You don't want to put everything, word to word, on the google slides. You should be able to talk about a certain slide without reading it off the slide, therefore, the details should not be written in detail on the slides, instead, one should memorize what he or she is going to say during the presentation.


## Next Step
- Be ready to present my google slides in front of the other classmates.
